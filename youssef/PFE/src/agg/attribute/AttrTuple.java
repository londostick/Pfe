/* 
 * This is an abstract interface and is extended by AttrType and AttrInstance.
 * Its purpose is to provide a common observable pattern to attribute objects
 * as well as a common mechanism for querying their state and representation.
 * A tuple consists of one or several entries. Each entry has typically three components:
 * a type, a name and a value. It's up to the implementation to distribute these components
 * between AttrType and AttrInstance.
 * @see agg.attribute.AttrType
 * @see agg.attribute.AttrInstance
 * 
 * A client can register and de-register as an observer of an attribute 
 * tuple. In order to do so, he must implement the AttrObserver interface.
 * It involves the implementation of an updating method and a test if
 * the client claims persistency on the client's side.
 * @see agg.attribute.AttrObserver
 
 * Querying can refer to the absolute (core) state or, provided a supplied instance of
 * AttrViewSetting, address the tuple's representation relative to a customized view.
 * @see agg.attribute.AttrViewSetting
