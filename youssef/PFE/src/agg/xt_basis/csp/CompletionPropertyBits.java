/**
 * This interface defines symbolic names for the properties that can be asked
 * from a morphism completion strategy. These are names for the bits of a
 * <code>BitSet</code> that is used to define which properties are supported
 * by a concrete completion strategy and which properties are actually set.
 * <p>
 * Example 1: When you want to know if a given strategy <code>strat</code>
 * supports restriction to completions that satisfy the dangling condition, you
 * would ask <code>strat.getSupportedProperties().get(DANGLING)</code>.
 * <p>
 * Example 2: When you want a strategy to find only injective completions, you
 * would do <code>strat.getProperties().set(INJECTIVE)</code>. Setting a
 * property that is not supported will have no effect.
 * <p>
 * Example 3: You can access all available property bits - supported or
 * unsupported - in a loop, without having to name each bit explicitly. The
 * following sample code prints the names of all available bits to standard out:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * for (int i = 0; i &lt; CompletionPropertyBits.BITNAME.length; i++)
 * 	System.out.println(CompletionPropertyBits.BITNAME[i]);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * @see java.util.BitSet
 * @see agg.util.StrategyProperties
